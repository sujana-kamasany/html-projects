**What is HTML?**

- HTML is the heart of the entire web. Whatever content we see online is based on HTML.
- If you simply right-click on any web page and click on View Source, you will be able to see loads of tags, the first one being <html> which means the document is an HTML file. 

The basic structure of HTML:
          
              <!DOCTYPE HTML>
              <html>
              <head>
                  <title>Title of the page</title>
              </head>
              <body>
                  <form action="some_action" method="POST">
                  </form>
              </body>
              </html>
